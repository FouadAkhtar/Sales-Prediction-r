# Sales Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict sales based on marketing data using multiple linear regression. The dataset includes information on various marketing channels, such as Facebook, youtube, newspapers, etc., and their respective impact on sales.

## Objective

The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can analyze the influence of different marketing channels on sales. By leveraging multiple linear regression, we aim to uncover insights into the effectiveness of each channel and optimize marketing strategies for increased sales.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import necessary R libraries.
   - Load and explore the marketing dataset.
   - Handle missing values and preprocess the data.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Explore relationships between marketing channels and sales.
   - Visualize data patterns and correlations.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Create and train a multiple linear regression model.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

5. **Interpretation:**
   - Analyze the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each marketing channel on sales.
   - Draw insights and recommendations for marketing strategy optimization.
